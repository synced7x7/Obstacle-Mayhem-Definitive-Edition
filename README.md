This is a passionate project. Its not completed because I want to focus on other parts of my study. 
Made using unity, I tried to replicate the game SNK vs Capcom 2 released around 2001. 
I have made the base character IORI YAGAMI and implemented almost every moveset from the game.
There were some additional movesets taken from other games.
Basically I wanted to make Iori as much as OP as he can get.
I had also implemented KYO moveset which was more optimized but then i realised that it will take lifetime to complete the whole game and i really needed to focus on other parts of my studies too.
I have learned the fundamental of the game dev using SDL (really hard) while making Obstacle Mayhem. If you are interested you can look into my repo.

A major thing that was removed from this game (i really regret but its for the betterment) is the MOVE CANCEL MECHANISM.
Move cancel mechansim basically connects every move like a spider web. You can shift from one move to another with faster keypress. It will be simultaneous and make the game more promising. But one had to be pro to do that
as it requires proper timing and perfect keypress.
But it produced a huge amount of bugs. So I needed to remove it completely as I didn't had time to work through all over the moves again.
I decided to end it suddenly but I really enjoyed in making this project.
Hope to continue making projects but smaller one ofcourse.
